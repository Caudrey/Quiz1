Hello, I am Cecilia Audrey Herli from PPTI 12 BCA and this is a product website. This website is made for web development course as a project from my lecturer (Anderies, B.Eng., S.Kom., M.Kom.). 

In here, you can see some information about the product, such as name, rarity, photo, price, and description. The rarity will decide the color of the product/card. 

In the list product, the description is only a short one. When you hover the card, it will change color as a response. And when you click it, it will take you to the detailed page where there is a full description.
